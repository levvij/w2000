# w2000
A Windows 2000 clone thingy.

I have developed this project back in 2019 almost entirely on my phone on the way to school. It *might not* represent my current software design strategies, but TSC just did'nt work on my phone.

> I have removed some of the broken code that used to connect to my PHP server (yes it was not very nice) in order to make it at least boot. This breaks a lot of features.

Check out the console, everything is logged there too.
